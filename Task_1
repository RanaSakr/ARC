Problem: Guess the Secret Number with Conditions
Write a program where a user is allowed 5 attempts to guess a secret number.

The secret number is randomly chosen between 1 and 20.
If the user's guess is less than the secret number, display: "Too low! Try again."
If the user's guess is greater than the secret number, display: "Too high! Try again."
Use continue to skip directly to the next guess attempt if the guess is incorrect.
If the user guesses correctly, stop the loop immediately using break and print "Congratulations! You guessed it!"
If all 5 attempts are used and the user doesn't guess correctly, print "Game over! The secret number was X."

Example Run:
Guess the number between 1 and 20! You have 5 attempts.
Attempt 1: 10
Too low! Try again.

Attempt 2: 15
Too high! Try again.

Attempt 3: 12
Too low! Try again.

Attempt 4: 18
Congratulations! You guessed it!
